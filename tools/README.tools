This folder contains few extra nuggets, scripts that somehow use the plaso
libraries or other files that can be used with plaso. In other words useful
tools that use the underlying infrastructure to perform actions that are not
part of the original design.

There is no formal setup file for any of the scripts here, these are mostly
provided here as a PoC showing what can be done using the plaso libraries
to extend the tool.

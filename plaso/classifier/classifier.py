"""This file contains the format classifier classes.

Plaso is a tool that extracts events from files on a file system.
For this it either reads files from a mounted file system or from an image.
It uses an exhaustive approach to determine parse events from a file, meaning
that it passes the file first to parser A and if that fails it continues with
parser B.

The classifier is designed to be able to more quickly determine the format of
a file and limit the number of parsers part of the exhaustive approach.

The current version of the classifier uses signatures to identify file formats.
Some signatures must always be defined at a specific offset, this is referred to
as an offset-bound signature or bound for short. Other signatures are commonly
found at a specific offset but not necessarily. The last form of signatures is
unbound, meaning that they don't have a fixed or common location where they can
be found.

A specification is a collection of signatures with additional metadata that
defines a specific file format. These specifications are grouped into a store
for ease of use, e.g. so that they can be read from a configuration file all
at once.

The classifier requires a scanner to analyze the data in a file. The scanner
uses the specifications in a store to scan for the signatures or a certain
format.

The classifier allows for multiple methods of scanning a file:
* full:      the entire file is scanned. This is the default scanning method.
* head-tail: only the beginning (head) and the end (tail) of the file is
             scanned. This approach is more efficient for larger files.
             The buffer size is used as the size of the data that is scanned.
             Smaller files are scanned entirely.

The classifier returns zero or more classifications which point to a format
specification and the scan results for the signatures defined by
the specification.

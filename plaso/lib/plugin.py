"""This file contains basic interface for plugins within Plaso.

This library serves a basis for all plugins in Plaso, whether that are
Windows registry plugins, SQLite plugins or any other parsing plugins.

This is provided as a separate file to make it easier to inherit in other
projects that may want to use the Plaso plugin system.

  """A plugin is a lightweight parser that makes use of a common data structure.

  When a data structure is common amongst several artifacts or files a plugin
  infrastructure can be written to make writing parsers simpler. The goal of a
  plugin is have only a single parser that understands the data structure that
  can call plugins that have specialized knowledge of certain structures.

  An example of this is a SQLite database. A plugin can be written that has
  knowledge of certain database, such as Chrome history, or Skype history, etc.
  This can be done without needing to write a full fledged parser that needs
  to re-implement the data structure knowledge. A single parser can be created
  that calls the plugins to see if it knows that particular database.

  Another example is Windows registry, there a single parser that can parse
  the registry can be made and the job of a single plugin is to parse a
  particular registry key. The parser can then read a registry key and compare
  it to a list of available plugins to see if it can be parsed.

  This method takes a stat object and creates an EventContainer

  The constraints are that the stat object implements an iterator
  that returns back values all timestamp based values have the
  attribute name 'time' in them. All timestamps also need to be
  stored as a Posix timestamps.

  Args:
    stat: A stat object, preferably a pfile.Stat object.
    is_allocated: A boolean variable defining if the file is
    currently allocated or not.

  Returns:
    An EventContainer that contains an EventObject for each extracted

"""bencode_interface contains basic interface for bencode plugins within Plaso.

Bencoded files are only one example of a type of object that the Plaso tool is
expected to encounter and process.  There can be and are many other parsers
which are designed to process specific data types.

BencodePlugin defines the attributes neccessary for registration, discovery
and operation of plugins for bencoded files which will be used by
BencodeParser.

    the most relevant data set into a useful event for incorporation into the
    Plaso timeline.

    The attributes for a BencodeEvent should include the following:

  Any pre-processing plugin that implements this interface
  should define which operating system this plugin supports.

  The OS variable supports the following values:
    + Windows
    + Linux
    + MacOSX

  Since some plugins may require knowledge gained from
  other checks all plugins have a weight associated to it.
  The weight variable can have values from one to three:
    + 1 - Requires no prior knowledge, can run immediately.
    + 2 - Requires knowledge from plugins with weight 1.
    + 3 - Requires knowledge from plugins with weight 2.

  The default weight of 3 is assigned to plugins, so each
  plugin needs to overwrite that value if needed.

  The plugins are grouped by the operating system they work
  on and then on their weight. That means that if the tool
  is run against a Windows system all plugins that support
  Windows are grouped together, and only plugins with weight
  one are run, then weight two followed by the rest of the
  plugins with the weight of three. There is no priority or
  guaranteed order of plugins that have the same weight, which
  makes it important to define the weight appropriately.
